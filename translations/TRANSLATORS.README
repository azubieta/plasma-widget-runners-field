Translation instructions:
-------------------------

1.- Copy the .pot file (language catalog template) as 
    <your_language>.po. For instance: fr.po for French, it.po Italian
    and so on.

2.- Open <your_language>.po file with Lokalize (http://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize)

3.- Then, you'll have to translate each label into your language. You have
    to be very careful not to remove numbers starting with %, like %1, %2, as
    they are parameters for the labels. For instance, the label "Hello %1!"
    might be printed like "Hello Jonh!", if the user happens to be named so.
    You must be also careful with HTML tags like <b>something</b>. Finally,
    you will be provided with a context to let you know what %1 is referred to
    when considered appropriate.

4.- Save your translation file.

5.- Open the metadata.desktop file and you'll find a couple of lines like the following:

        Name=KRunner Widget
        Comment=Radio applet that allows you to embed krunner in your system panel.

    Then, add your language in the same way as it has been done for other languages such as:

        Name[es]=KRunner Widget
        Comment[es]=Componente de Plasma5 que le permite colocar kruner en su panel.

6.- Save it all and send it to azubieta90[AT]gmail{DOT}com, where
    [AT] is '@' character and {DOT} is '.' character.

Thanks a lot for your contribution!
